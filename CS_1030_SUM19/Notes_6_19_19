        + Errors with data transmission can slow performance 
        + Securit Concern:
            * Wireless signals are east to intercept
            * Never use password at store WiFis
    - Local area networks (LAN)
        + Wired connection 
        + Computers, printers, and servers are in close proximity
        + Examples:
            * Same Room,
            * printers
            * Servers are in close proximity 
        + Privately owned and operated 
        + Topology:
            * How computers are connected, Affects how they communicate 
        + Can be made up of different types of systems and OS installs (Mac, Linux, Windows, or Android)
    - Bus Topology
        + Shared lines 
        + Devices take turns using the line 
    - Ring Topology 
        + Messages circulate until they reach the source 
    - Star Topology 
        + All messages are sent to a central node, which routes messages to their destinations 
    - Wide Area Networks (WANs)
        + Wired connection 
        + Connected computers, located at great distances 
        + Dedicated Point-to-point lines 
            1. Computers connect to other computers on individual lines 
        + Store-and-forward, packet-switched 
            2. Packets - go from node to node until reaching their destination 
    - Overall Structure of the Internet 
        + Combination of LANs and WANs 
        + Connected by routers that direct message traffic 
        + Internet service provider (ISP) 
            1. Provides access to the Internet for private individuals and organizations 
        + Domain Name Services (DNS) 
            2. Provide addressing information, Convert URLS to IP addresses 
        + ISPs exist at multiple levels:
            1. Local
            2. Regional 
            3. National 
            4 Internation (Tier-1 network)
IV. Communication Protocols
    - Protocol
        + A standard set of rules for communicating 
    - Protocol Hierarchy/Protocol stack, TCP/IP 
        + Laters of Protocols (Transmission Control Protocol)
        + Phsyical transmission to end application rules and standards 
    - Internet Society
        + Makes Standards and promotes research 
            * Standards evolve over time 
    - International agreements make Internet Possible 
V. Network layers
    - Network Layer Protocols 
        + Transmit messages across multiple nodes in a network 
        + Requirements:
            * Standard for addressing all network nodes 
            * Routing method for finding a route from any node to any other node 
        + Internet Network Layer: IP (Internet Protocol)
    - Addressing: 
        + Host name: human-friendly name for node 
        + IPv4 Address: unique numerical address used by the computer, 141.140.1.5 Running out of IPv4 addresses,
            using IPv6 addresses now, too.
        + Domain Name Service (DNS): maps host names to IP adresses 
            * Symbolic Host name goes to a local DNS server 
            * If it has no record, goes to remote serves until one has the host name and retrieves the IP address 
        + Routing:
            * Picking a path through the network from source to destination 
            * Seeks the shortest/best path: fastest travel 
            * Massive network requires efficient path-seeking 
            * Networks are dynamic: nodes come online and go offline all the time - routing must adapt quickly 
VI. Transport Layer 
    - Transport layer protocols 
        + application-to-application, reliable packet delivery 
        + Port Number: unique identifer for a program 
    - Application types have standard port numbers
        + Web server > port 80 
        + Domain Name Service > port 42 
        + SMTP, sending email > port 25 
    - TCP (Transport Control Protocol)
        + Ensures no errors 
        + Establishes ordered deliver of packets 
        + Another version of ARQ algorithm 
        + Virtual direct, quality connection between programs 
VII. Application Layer 
    - Application Layer protocols 
        * Handle formatted data transmitted between application programs 
    - Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) 
        + Web page/service is identified by a unique URL (Uniform Resource Locator) 
        + Web Browsers uses TCP to send formatted messages to a web server, and vicee versa 
    - Process:
        + Browser reads protocol, extracts host name (and request iP address from the DNS server)
        + Sends a connection message to port 80 on that machine 
        + After connection is established, sends "Get" message with page information 
        + Server responds with message containing page contents and size and indicates the connection closes at the end of the message 
VIII. Network Services and Benefits Interpersonal Communications
