Production and the Costs of Production 

I. Production Function:
    - Represents the maximum amount of output producible with various combinations of inputs given
    technology and the quality or skill of inputs.
    - Qoutput = f(Labor, Capital, Materials, Technology)
        + For every combination of inputs there is an amount of output that can be produced 
II. Production is looked at in different time periods
    - The Short Run 
        + The short run is assumed so short that at least one input is fixed in quantity
    - The Long Run 
        + In the long run it is assumed that the firm has enough time to vary all inputs in whatever
        proportion it beleves is desirable to vary the scale of production.
    - The Very Long Run 
        + A period of time long enough where the firm can vary the technology it is using.
    - Diminishing marginal returns iplies the marginal product of the input is decreasing as more of
    as more of the input is used in production.
    - Marginal Product = the change in output as one more unit of an input is employed
        * MPlabor = ChangeOutput/ ChangeQlabor employed 
    - Average Product of an Input = the output produced per unit of input used in production,
    i.e. output per labor is the average product of labor. EX = APl = TP/L 
III. Relationship between MP and TP
    - As long as MP is increasing, TP will increase at increasing rate 
    - When MP starts diminishing, TP will increase but at a decreasing rate 
    - When MP is zero, TP remains unchanged and is at its maximum
    - When MP is negative, TP starts decreasing 
IV. Relationships between MP and AP 
    - AP increases till MP > AP 
    - AP decreases when MP < AP 
    - AP is maximum when AP = MP 
    - MP can be zero or negative, but AP continues to be positive always 

    - A firm's short-run cost curves are a reflection of the law of diminishing marginal product. 
    - Given any constant price of the variable input, marginal cost decline as long as the marginal 
    product of the variable resources is rising. 

More Pruduction & Costs

I. Economic vs Accounting Costs 
    - Economists define cost in terms of opportunites that are sacrificed when a choise is made.
        + Hence, economic costs are simply benefits lost (and, in some cases, benefits are merely
        costs avoided).
        + Economic Costs are subjective, seen from the perspective of a decision maker not a detached
        observer.
    - Moreover, economic costs are incurred when decisions are made. They include implicit costs.
II. Accounting costs
    - Accountants define cost in terms of resources consumed.
        + Hence, from an accountant's standpoint, costs are objective. Seen from the perspective of
        a detached observer.
        + Accounting costs are often referred to as explicit costs by economists. 
        + Costs incurred and actually paid out! 
III. Implicit Costs 
    - Implicit costs are cost incurred but not paid out, i.e. no money flows out. These are opportunity costs 
    - The cost that both agree on is depreciation of capital.
    - depreciation is the opportunity costs of the firm using capital that it owns.
        + It is measured as the change in the market value of capital, the market price of the capital
        at the beginning of the period minus its market price at the end of the period 
    - In terms of accounting
        + Total Cost = Total Explicit costs 
    - In Economics
        + Total Cost = total explicit plus implicit costs 
IV. Long Run 
    - A period long enough so that all inputs are variable. 
    - This includes, in particular, capital, plant, equipment, and the other investments that represent
    long-term commitments.
    - Another Way to think of "the long run"
        + It is the perspective of investment planning 
        + In the long-run a firm can choose any amount of fixed costs it wants for making short-run decisions.
    - Suppose you were planning to build a new plant, perhaps to set up a whole new company, and you know about
    how much output you will be producing.
    - Then you want to build your plant so as to produce that amount at the lowest possible average cost
    - We know one thing, for every level of capital invested in by the company, there is a new product and new
    cost curve.
