    - Reference:
        ~ https://docs.python.org/2/library/pydoc.html

I. Pydoc
    - Generates documentation form Python modules.
    - The Doucmenation can be presened as pages of text on the console
        * This can then be served to a Web Browser, or Saved to HTML Files
    - For modules, classes, functions and methods
        * The displayed documentation is derived from the docstring 
            ~ Example:
                + the __doc__ attribute of the object
                + Recursively of its documentable members. 
                + If there is no docstring
                    >> pydoc tries to obtain a description from the block of comment lines just above the definition of the
                    >> Class function
                    >> Method in the source file
                    >> At the top of the module (see inspect.getcomments()).
II. Help()
    - The built-in function help() invokes the online help system in the interactive interpreter
    - Which uses pydoc to generate its documentation as text on the console.
    - The same text documentation can also be viewed from outside the Python interpreter
        * by running pydoc as a script at the operating systemâ€™s command prompt
            ~ pydoc sys 
        * At a shell prompt will display documentation on the sys module
            ~ In a style similar to the manual pages shown by the Unix man command. 
    -  The argument to pydoc can be the name of a:
        * Function
        * Module
        * Package
        * Dotted reference to a class, method, or function within a module or module in a package.
    - If the argument to pydoc looks like a path to an existing Python source file
        * (that is, it contains the path separator for your operating system, such as a slash in Unix)
        * Then documentation is produced for that file.
III. When Printing output to the console 
    - Pydoc attempts to paginate the output for easier reading.
    - If the PAGER environment variable is set:
        * Pydoc will use its value as a paginator program.
    - Specifiying a -w flag before the argument will cause HTML documenation to be written out to a file in the current directory
        * Instead of displaying text on the console.
    - Specifiying a -k flag before the argument will search the synopsis lines of all available modules for the keyword given as the argument.
        * Again in a manner similar to the Unix man command.
    - The synopsis line of a module is the first line of its documenation string.
        * You can use pydoc to start an HTTP server on the local machine that will serve documentation to visiting Web Browsners.
