I. Product Possibilies
    a) Scarcity and Resources:
        - Resources or factors of production are inputs used in the production of things that people want.
        - Production is any activity that results in the conversion of resources into products that can be
            used in consumption.
        1. Land
            * Land is often called the natural resource and consists of all the gifts of nature.
        2. Labor
            * Labor is the human resource that includes all productive contributions made by individuals 
                who work and involves both mental and physical activities.
        3. Physical Capital
            * Capital is all manufactured resources that are used for production.
            * It also includes improvements to natural resources, such as irrigation ditches.
        4. Human Capital
            * The accumulated training and education works receive that increases their productivity.
        5. Entrepreneurship
            * Human resources that perform the functions of organizing, managing, and assembling the other
                factors of production to create and operate business ventures and that take the risks associated
                with introducing new methods and other types of new thinking that could lead to more monetary income.
    b) Technology
        - Technology is simply a constraint used to describe the limits of how inputs and resources can be combined in 
            order to produce a good or service.
        - Improvements in technology allow less resources and inputs to be used to produce the same amount of goods.
        - It also generally allows for better quality, i.e. quality control.
    c) Production Possiblities Frontier
        - Represents the maximum amount of output producible in an economy during a given period of time, given the economy's
            resources, inputs, and technology.
        - If inputs are unemployed or underutilized (underemployed) production will be less than the maximum output possible
            as shown by the frontier.
        - Every distribution of inputs between industries results in a different composition of outputs produced.
        - Production is thus subject to opportunity costs.
II. Positive versus Normative Economics
    - The text points out the normative economics can be identified by the use of the word "should."
    - Other words that provide a flag that a normative statement instead of a positive statement is being made are good,
        bad, best, desirable, undesirable, better, and worse.
    - Examples of these are as follows:
        1. An increase in extended unemployment benefits is good because the benefits reduce the hardship faced by the unemployed.
        2. Increases in interest rates by the Federal Reserve are bad because higher interest rates hurt low-income borrowers.
        3. The best policy to get the economy out of a recession is to cut taxes.
        4. High gasoline prices are undesirable.
        5. It would be desirable to lower the prices of drugs to combat AIDS in poor countires.
        6. The increase in prescription drug prices undesirable because many senior citizens must choose between their drugs and food.
        7. It is better to increase the progressive income tax than to increase a regressive sales tax.
        8. Of the two methods of financing the war in Afghanistan, it is better to raise taxes on the American people rather
            than borrow the money.
        9. An increase in extended unemployment benefits is bad because the benefits reduce the incentives of the unemployed
            to find a job.
    - Positive economics deals with what is
    - Normative economics statements are "if-then" statements.
    - Normative economics deals with what some person thinks ought to be.
    - Normative economic statements involve value judgments and normally have the works "ought" or "should" in them.
    - Because Positive economics predicts consequences of actions, it can be used to predict the effects of various policies to
        see if the the policies aid in achieving desired goals.
    - Positive economics cannot provide criteria for choosing which outcomes or goals are preferable.
    a) Distinguishing between Positive and Normative Economics:
        * Positive economics
            + Is analysis that is strictly limited to making either purely descriptive statements or scientific predictions.
        * Normative economics
            + Is analysis involving value judgments about economic policies, a statement about what ought to be.
    b) A Warning Recognize Normative analysis
        * Although it is easy to define positive economics, it is often difficult to identify unlabeled normative statements,
            even in a textbook.
