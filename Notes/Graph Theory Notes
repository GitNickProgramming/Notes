1. Graph Theory
    a) The study of graphs, which are mathematical structures used to model pairwise relations between objects.
        - A graph in this context is made up of vertices (also called nodes or points) which are connected by edges (also called links or lines).
    b) Undirected graphs
        - A set of objects (called vertices or nodes) that are connected together, where all the edges are bidirectional.
        - Edges link two vertices symmetrically
    c) Directed graphs
        - A set of objects (called vertices or nodes) that are connected together, where all the edges are directed from one vertex to another.
        - Where edges link two vertices asymmetrically
