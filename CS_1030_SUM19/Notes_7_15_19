        ~ ENIAC computing artillery ballistic tables
        ~ Turing's Colossus breaking the Enigma Code
    - Discuss all the non-scientific uses for computers in the modern day.
III. Computational Modeling
    - The scientific method entails observing the ehavior of a system, forming hypothesis, and performing experiements to test it.
    - A Model:
        ~ Is a representation of a real system that can be used to study it.
    - Physical models are physical objects that are different in scale and function than the thing itself.
    - Computational Models:
        ~ Are simulations
        ~ Equations and algorithms inside a computers
        ~ Also called simulation models 
    - Why experiment on a simulation model?
        ~ Existence:
            + Real system may not exist yet
        ~ Phsical realization:
            + System may not be made of physical things (e.g., social systems)
        ~ Safety:
            + System may be unsafe to experiment with (e.g., nuclear reactor design)
        ~ Speed of construction:
            + physical model may take too long to build.
    - Why experiment on a simulation model?
        ~ Time Scale:
            + Physical system may happen too fast or too slow to experiment.
        ~ Ethical Behavior:
            + Experimenting on physical system may be ethically wrong.
        ~ Ease of Modification:
            + Can change the model quickly and easily.
    - Computational Steering:
        ~ Is the act of tweaking the design until a satisfactory simulation has been developed:
            + Step 1: Build simulation model of design.
            + Step 2: Test and experiment on model.
            + Step 3: Refine design.
    - Can be used for the design of brand-new systems and for improving on existing systems.
    - Models balance between accuracy and complexity.
    - Al models include some features and omit others
        ~ Example:
            + Model of falling mass.
        ~ Omits effects of air resistance.
        ~ Assumes costant gravity
    - Continuous model:
        ~ A formula based on continuous time.
    - Stochastic components:
        ~ Elements of randomness.
    - Discrete event simulation:
        ~ Models time as discrete steps:
            + Events are activities that change the state of system.
            + Examples: customer enters store, customer purchases items, customer leaves store.
        ~ Simulate only times where events take place:
            + Keep a list of events and their scheduled times.
            + Repeat:
                > Advance time to time of next event.
                > Skip any intervening time steps.
                > Perform next event's actions.
    - Example Simulation: McBurger
        ~ Determine how many checkout stations for a fast food restaurant.
        ~ Single line of customers 
        ~ N server stations.
        ~ If server is free, next customer goes.
        ~ Server is busy while customer orders, waits, and pays.
    - Example Simulation: McBurger 
        ~ Events in this model 
            + Customer arrives
                > Adds to line or makes idle server busy
            + Customer departs 
                > Removes customer from line or makes server idle 
        ~ Construct algorithms for each event.
            + Update state of simulation for event
            + Record data to be collected
    - Example Simulation: McBurger 
        ~ For each customer, record:
            + Time spent waiting (Tdepart - Tarrive - Tserve)
            + Time being served (Tserve)
        ~ For each server, record:
            + Total time spent serving
    - Example Simulation: McBurger 
        ~ Time being served, Tserve, is stochastic 
        ~ Generate based on statistical distribution 
            + Equation that captures probabilities of different values occurring.
        ~ Derive distribution from external sources
            + Other restaurants 
        ~ Garbage in, garbage out:
            + Quality of the results depend on quality of data and assumptions.
    - Example simulation: McBurger 
        ~ To generate stochastic time:
            + Generate a value of distribution 
            + Use that to generate a time
        ~ Uniform random number 
            + Chosen randomly from a range of values
            + All values equally likely to bbe chosen.
    - Example Simulation: McBurger 
        ~ Outcomes: What data should be reported?
            + Average customer waiting time
            + Server busy percentage.
        ~ Try the model, examine the result.
        ~ Retry with different parameters
IV. Running the model and visualizing the results
    - Real-worl models require many more computations 
    - NERSC climate system model 
        ~ 10^17 computations 
            + Requires large parallel computer systems 
        ~ Produces 500 million data values
        ~ CERN example: 2 petabyes/second!
    - Scientific visualization:
        ~ Methods for visualizing data to highlight important characteristics 
        ~ Not computer graphics 
    - Example 1:
        ~ Model of ocean tides 
        ~ Produces predicted tide height for every 30 seconds of 24-hour day.
        ~ Displays as a graph, easier to see features 
    - Example 2: Model of tides and temperatures 
        ~ Produces twice as much data 
        ~ Displays both sets of data on one graph 
        ~ Interactions become more evident 
    - Example 3: model of forest fire intensity
        ~ Three-dimensional data and visualization 
        ~ Hottest: yellow and red 
        ~ Coolest: blue and green 
    - Example 4: Model of Chemical Compound:
        ~ Give 3-d display of atoms and chemical bonds
        ~ Can animate chemical reactions/changes 
        ~ Use color and size to identify parts
    - Example 5: Model of Tsunami Waves 
        ~ Color indicates wave heights 
            + Purple == Highest
            + Yellow == Lowest 
        ~ Integrated with map data 
    - Example 6: Model of Atmospheric ozone over one year 
        ~ Models where results appear over time 
        ~ Image animation: A movie showing changes 
        ~ One image perday 
        ~ Colors indicate ozone amounts 
V. Summary
    - Models are used to experiment with systems that are difficult or imposible to work with for real.
    - Compuational simlation models can be built and modified faster than physical models and can change the time or size 
    scale to be more workable.
    - Ethical dlemmas can be avoided using simulations 
    - Choose important features for accuracy; keep complexity manageable.
    - Models may be discrete or continuus, deterministic or stochastic.
    - Discrete event simulations jump from one event of a system to the next, skipping intervening time steps.
    - Simulations like the McBurger example can be used to test the outcomes of design decisions.
    - Some real-worl simulations require massive computing resources.
    - Data visualization makes model outcomes easier to understand.
