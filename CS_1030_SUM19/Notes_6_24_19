II. Introduction
    - Information Security 
        + Keep information safe
        + Control access to authorized people only
    - Physical security 
        + Lock Doors
        + maintain control devices
    - Online Security 
        + Secure assembly language
        + Secure operating system 
        + Secure network 
III. Threats and Defenses 
    - THreats online are often more dangerous than threats to physical items
    - Hackers prefer to attack easily accessible data 
    - Multiple deterrents to online attacks
IV. Threats and Defenses Authentication and Authorization 
    - Authentication 
        + establishing identity
    - Require usernames and passwords 
    - Secure a password file with a hash function;
    - Example: Password = badboy2
        + Replace letters by numbers: 214215352
        + Add digits: 2 + 1 + 4 + 2 + 15 + 25 + 2 + 51
        + Remainder of sum/7: 51 mod 7 = 2
        + Add 1 and multiply by 9: (2 + 1) x 9 = 27
        + Reverse digits and convert to leterrs 72 = gb
    - Password file security: no plaintext password stored
    - On login
        + Read username and password 
        + look up entry for username in a password file 
        + Hash input password and compare
    - More secure method
        + Keep password creation time
        + Add creation time to password before hashing 
        + identical password won't hash to identical values
    - Password Attacks 
        + Guess password, brute force or from knowledge 
            * Try common passwords (e.g. 123456)
            * Try personal references (e.g. pet name)
            * Try all possible password (computationally difficult)
        + Steal password file and use password-cracking software
            * Tries words and word combinations, millions of password possibilities per 
                second.
        + Social Engineering:
            * Get a person to tell password 
    - Other Authentication methods
        + Answer personal information question
        + Biometric information (fingerprint or retinal scans)
        + One-time password scheme 
            * User enters ID and partial password 
            * System or user device generates last half of the password 
            * Last half of the password is good for only a few seconds
        + Dual Authentication:
            * Temporary code or password is sent to a trusted device 
    - Authorization
        + set of permitted actions for each authorized person 
    - Operating system maintains access control lists
        + Read access 
        + Write access
        + Execute access 
        + Delete access 
    - System administrator or superuser has universal access and sets up authorization 
    - Malware:
        + Malicious software arriving from network.
    - Virus:
        + Program embedded within another program or file, replicates itself and attacks other files
    - Trojan horse:
        + Program that seems beneficial but hides malicious code within it
        + Keystroke logger : records all keys typed
        + Drive-by exploit/Drive-by download:
            * Trojan horse downloaded by simply visiting an infected website 
    - Denial-of-service (DoS) attack:
        + many computers try to access the same URL at the same time 
        + Clogs the network, prevents legitimate access, and causes the server to crash
        + Distributed DoS uses thousands of computers 
            * Uses a zombie army (botnet): many innocent computers infected with Malware
    - Phishing:
        + obtain sensitive information by impersonating legitimate sources
        + Many emails; just afew "bites" are enough
    - White hats are security experts and those who work to help protect systems from attackers
    - Black hats are individuals or groups who work toward getting around security to steal informaton,
        get money, or do other nefarious, immoral, and illegal acts
V. Encrpytion Overview 
    - Cryptography:
        + Science of "secret writing"
    - Encryption and decryption (inverse operations)
        + Convert from plaintext to ciphertext and back again 
    - Symmetric encryption algorithm 
        + A Secret key shared by the sender and receiver
        + Same key is used to encrypt and decrypt 
    - Asymmetric encryption algorithm (public key)
        + Uses two keys: Public and Private 
        + Use public key (generally known) to encrypt 
        + Use private key (known only to receiver) to decrypt 
    - Caesar Cipher (shift cipher)
        + Map characters to others a fixed distance away in the alphabet
        + Example:
            * A > E, B > F, C > G 
    - Substitution cipher:
        + Similar, but implement other mappings
        + Pros:
            * easy and fast, can do character by character 
        + Cons: 
            * letter frequency, double leters, still pertain, make it easy to break
VI. Encryption (DES) Data Encryption Standard
    - Symmetric encryption algorithm 
    - Design for digital data; plaintext is a binary string 
    - Uses 64-bit binary key (56 bits actually uses)
    - Sixteen rounds of the same series of manipulations
    - Decryption uses the same algorithm; key in Reverse
    - Fast and effective but requires shared key 
        + 56 bits is too small for modern technology 
    - AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)
        + uses a similar approach; longer keys
    - DES manipulations
        + Split string 
        + duplicatiing some bits 
        + Omit some bits 
        + Permute bit order 
        + Combine bit strings with XOR (exclusive or) = 1 if the bits are different
            = 0, if they are the same 
VII. Encryption Public-Key systems 
    - RSA key creation 
        + Pick 2 large prime numbers: p and q 
        + Compute n = p x q, and m = (p - 1) x (q - 1) 
        + Choose large number e at random so that e and m are relatively prime (no common factors execept 1)
        + Find unique value d, between 0 and m, such that (e x d) modulo m = 1
        + Public key = (n, e); Private key = d 
VIII. Web Transmission Security 
    - Ecommerce requires secure transmission of names, passwords, and credit card numbers 
    - Web protocols: SSL (Secure sockets layer) and TLS (Transport layer Security)
        + Client-server applications
        + Server provides certificate of authentication and server's public key 
        + Client sends DES key, encrypted using RSA 
        + Data is sent encrypted by the (now shared) DES key 
IX. Embedded Computing 
    - Embedded computers: 
        + special-purpose, limited computers in other systems.
