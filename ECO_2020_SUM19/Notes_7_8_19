Homework
    -

I. Perfect Competition
    - Many number of firms
    - Homogeneous type of product
    - No barriers to Entry
    - No non-price compeition 
    - No influence on price
II. Monopolistic Competition 
    - Mnay number of firms 
    - Differentiated type of products
    - No Barriers to entry 
    - A lot of non-price compeition 
    - Some influence on price in hte short run but none in the long run
- In the above markets, firms will only be able to earn a normal or fair return on their efforts in the long run.
  This is due to competition from new existing firms coming into the market and expanding. Recall, there are no
  barriers to entry.
- Fair Return
    * Revenue earned covers all cost including opportunity cost. 
    * People earn their opportunity cost.
    * To an exonomist, the firm is breaking even although it may be earning a positive accounting profit.

III. Oligopoly 
    - Few of other firms 
    - Can be any thing when it comes to product type
    - very difficult to enter market 
    - A lot of non-price competition 
    - Substantial firm influence on Price
IV. Monopoly 
    - One firm 
    - Unique type of product 
    - some non-price competition 
    - A firm's influence on Price
V. Duopoly
    - A special case of oligopoly where there are only 2 large firms

I. Perfect Competition 
    - There is perfect knowledge, with no information failure or time lags in the flow of information.
    - Knowledge is freely available to all participants, which means that risk-taking is minimal
    - Each firm takes the market price as a given assuming it can sell all it produces at that price.
    - The firm is such a small competitor that it simply has to produce the goods and the market will take them.
    - What drives firm behavior?
        * Rational behavior would be to maximize profits!
        * The industry, and hence the firm's price is determined by the interaction of Supply and Demand
        * If every firm is producing a product that is identical to everyone else's product, at least in the
        eyes of the consumer, any given firm can't charge a higher price.
II. Pricing Possibilities in the short run. We know, P = MC 
    - P > ATC 
        * Firm earns a positive economic profit 
    - P = ATC 
        * Firm earns a normal profit 
    - AVC < P < ATC 
        * Firm earns an economic loss but stays in business
    - P = AVC 
        * Firm just covers its variable costs, the shutdown point 
    - P < AVC 
        * Firm ceases operation and shuts down
