60 Markets: Perfect Competition
I. Long Run in Perfect Competition
    - In the long run, firms are able to exit or enter the industry bases on whether they can cover costs.
    - Firms can also change the scale of production and move to a new short run cost curve.
    - What happen if supernormal profits or positive economic are made?
        ~ If supernormal profits are made new firms will be attracted into the industry causing prices to fall.
        ~ If firms are making a loss then firms will leave the industry causing price to rise.
    - Firms are producing at the absolute minimum of the average total cost curve.
    - Costs may be different due to:
        ~ Differences in scale 
        ~ Differences in management 
        ~ Different locations
        ~ And so on
    - The lowest cost firms may be able to make a profit when other firms are earning an exonomic loss.
II. The Desirability of Perfect competition
    - The market is efficient and equitable
        ~ The price charged to individuals equals the marginal cost of production to each firm.
        ~ P = MC >> efficiency, the market is pricing the product such that the price equals the cost to society of
        producing the last good sold on the market.
        ~ The price charged to individuals equals the average cost of production to each firm.
        ~ P = ATC >> equity, the market is pricing the product such that the price equals ATC generating a fiar rate of return,
        equal to firm opportunity costs.
    - Output produced under a perfectly competitive market structure is larger than other markets organizations.
    - The sum of producer and consumer surplus is maximized.

62 Markets: Monopoly
I. Monopoply Characteristics
    - One firm
    - Very high barriers
    - A Unique Product 
    - Very little nonprice competition
II. Causes of Monopolies
    - Government mandated/gov't regulation 
    - A Firm has control of needed inputs
    - A Firm controls the production process
    - Economic/high start up costs leadings to substantial economies of scale- It is often natural for only one firm to produce
    all the goods in the market- this is the special case of a natural monopoly 
III. Important Concepts
    - The Realtion between MR and P for a monopolist
    - In order for the firm to be considered a monopoly, the product it sells must have no close substitutes available from other
    firms.
