I. Supply Curve
    - A supply curve shows the relationship between the quantity of a good or service supplied on the market by a firm at
        alternative prices.
    - Given:
        * Technology
        * The Price of other Goods
        * The prices of productive inputs
        * Expectations
        * The goal of the firm
        * The Type of market the firm is in
    - The firm will supply goods on the market as long as the revenue it can receive from selling the good is at least equal
        to a minimum acceptable revenue.
    - If the firm is assumed to be mazimizing profts, it will supply goods as long as the additional revenue from the last good
        offered for sale. ("Marginal" revenue)
    - It is at least equal to the addional cost associated with producing the last good ("Marginal cost").
    - If marginal cost is rising as output increases, the supply curve is upward sloping, prices must rise to generate firm profits.
II. A Change in quantity supplied
    - Refers to a change in behavior of sellers caused by a change in the price of the good.
    - In this case, the realtionship between price and quanity remains unchanged, but a new pair in the list of all possible pairs
        of price and quantity has been realized.
III. Shifting the supply curve 
    - A change in supply refers to a change in behavior of sellers caused because a factor held constant has changed.
    - As a result a change in supply, there is a new relationship between price and quantity.
    - At each price there will be a new quantity and at each quantity there will be a new price.
    - Variables
        * Price of the good itself
        * Input prices
        * Technology
        * Expectations
        * Number of sellers and/or price of other goods
IV. Market Supply
    - To get the total market supply we simply add up all the quantities of goods supplied by every firm at each price.
    - Add up all the Q's
    - The Market process is the interaction of supply and demand
    - Demand represents the maximum that consumers are willing to pay
    - Supply represents the minimum that sellers are willing to accept
        * When these are equal the market has achieve EQUILIBRIUM
    - if the market is stable, prices will always adjust back to the equilibrium.
    - If prices are too high, sellers find they are not selling all they want and will, at some point, begin to lower price.
    - The market will eventually settle at a lower price.
    - If the prices are too low, buyers begin to compete with each other for the limited goods and bid the price up till the market
        clears at point.
V. Market Failure
    - The Market fails when it is believe the equilibrium price and quantity is wrong:
        * The market is said to fail when it does not yield a price and quantity of a good which into consideration all costs 
            and benefits.
    - Causes:
        * Excess Market Power (Monopoly)
            + A single firm sets the price of the good and determines by itself what quantity of output to supply.
        * Inability of the Market to make people pay the optimal price 
            + Market cannot make people pay a price for benefits they do not directly receive.


I. Elasticity
    - Measures the responsiveness of a change in the quantity demanded of a good due to a change in the good's price.
    - The calculation is always negative, we only want the absolute value
    - The demand curve is downward sloping
    - We know that the value of elasticity will be negative.
    - We are more concerned with the absolute value of the price elasticity.
II. Elasticity and total revenue 
    - The concept of price elasticity of demand is extensively used by firms that are investigating the effects of a change 
        in the prices of their commodities.
    - Total Revenue:
        * price x quantity 
    - Suppose that a firm is facing a downward sloping demand curve for its product.
        * How will its revenue change if it lowers its price?
    - The answer, it turns out, is somewhat ambiguous.
    - When the price declines, quantity demanded by consumers rises.
    - The lower price received for each unit of output lowers total revenue while the increase in the number of units sold raises
        total revenue.
    - Total revenue will rise when the price falls if quantity rises by a large enough percentage to offset the reduction in the price 
        per unit.
    - In particular, we can note that total revenue will increase if quantity demanded rises by more than one percent when the price
        falls by one percent.
    - Alternatively, total revenue will decline if quantity demanded rises by less than one percent when the price declines by one percent
    - If the price falls by one percent and quantity demanded falls by one percent, total revenue will remain unchanged (since the 
        changes will offset each other).
III. Properties of Price Elasticity of Demand 
    - Price elasticity of demand is usually a negative number 
    - Only concerned with the absolute value of Ep 
    - |Ep| > 1
        * Indicates that the good is price elastic 
    - |Ep| < 1
        * indicates that the good is price inelastic
    - Given a linear demand curve, Ep is not constant along the curve 
IV. Determinants of Price Elasticity of Demand
    - The number of close substitues
        * The larger the number of close substitutes, the greater the value of price elasticity 
    - The type of good
        * A necessity has a low elasticity, luxury items have high elasticity
    - The Time period looked at:
        * Nondurables, goods which last less than three years 
        * Elasticity is higher in the long run, more time to find substitues 
        * Elasticity is lower in the short run, more inelastic, as items wear out they need to be replaced 
        * Durables
            + Goods with a life of more than three years 
            + Elasticity is higher, more eleastic, in the short run 
            + Elasticity is lower in the long run - Qd is less responsive
    - I know I am going to need to get a new computer. If PC prices rise this week, I can wait to purchase a new computer for a while.
        I wait till, hopefully, prices come down. Over Time, I still have to buy a new PC, regardless of the higher price. Q Demanded
        is seen as not falling due to the price increase: Demand is inelastic.
    - Size of Spending on a good relative to one's total budget
        * The importance or lack of importance in one's budget.
        * The larger the share of one's budget going to a good the larger elasticity.
V. Cross-Price Elasticity 
    - Shows the percentage change in the quantity demanded of a good relative to the change in the price of another good.
VI. Income elasticity of Demand 
    - How sensitive is the demand for a product to a change in the real incomes of consumers?
    - We use income elasticity of demand to measure this.
    - The results are important since the values of income elasticity tell us something about the nature of a product and how
        how it is perceived by consumers.
    - It also affects the extent to which changes in economic growth affect the level and pattern of demand for goods and services
    - Income elasticity of demand measures the relationship between a change in quantity demanded for good X and change in real income.
    - The Formula for calculating income elasticity:
        * % change in demand or quantity demanded Divided by the % of change in income.
