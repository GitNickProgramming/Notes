1. Purpose of the Scrum Guide
    - Scrum is a framework for developing, delivering, and sustaining complex products.
    - This definition consists of Scrum's roles, events, artificats, and the rules that bind them together.
    A) Scrum (n):
        - A Framework within which people can address complexx adaptive problems, 
        while productively and creatively delivering products of the highest possible value.
        
2. Scrum Theory
    - Scrum is founded on Empirical process control theory, or empiricism.
    - Empiricism asserts that knowledge comes from experience and making decisions based on what is known.
    A) Three Pillars:
        - Uphold every implementation of empirical process control:
            1) Transparency
            2) Inspection
            3) Adaptation

3. Transparency
    - Significant aspects of the process must be visible to those responsible for the outcome.
    - Transparency requires those aspects be defined by a common standard so observers share a common
    understanding of what is being seen.
    Example:
        + A common language referring to the process must be shared by all participants.
        + Those performing the work and those inspecting the resulting increment must share a common definition of "Done."

4. Inspection
    - Inspection are most beneficial when diligently performed by skilled inspectors at the point of work.
    - Their inspection should not be so frequent that inspection gets in the way of the work. 

5. Adaption
    - If an inspector determines that one or more aspects of a process deviate outside acceptable limits, and that the resulting
    product will be unaccpetable, the process or the material being processed must be adjusted.
    - An adjustment must be made as sooon as possible to minimize further deviation. 
    - Scrum prescribes four formal events for inspection and adaptation, as described in the Scrum Events.
    A) Scrum Events:
        + Sprint Planning
        + Daily Scrum
        + Sprint Review
        + Sprint Retrospective

6. Scrum Values
    - Commitment
    - Courage
    - Focus
    - Openness
    - Respect

7. The Scrum Team
    - The Scrum Team consists of a Product Owner, the Development Team, and the Scrum Master
    - Scrum Teams deliver products iteratively and incrementally, maximizing opportunities for Feedback
    - Incremental deliveries of "Done" product ensure a potentially useful version of working product is always available.

8. The Product Owner
    - The product owner is responsible for maximizing the value of the product resulting from work of the Development Team.
    - The product owner is the sole person responsible for managing the product backlog
    A) Product backlog
        + Clearly expressing Product Backlog items
        + Ordering the items in the Product Backlog to best achieve goals and missions
        + Optimizing the value of the work the Development Team Performs
        + Ensuring that the product backlog is visible, transparent, and clear to all, and shows what the Scrum Team will work on next
        + Ensuring the Development Team understands items in the Product Backlog to the level needed

9. The Development Team
    - The Development Team consists of professionals who do the work of delivering a potentially releasable Increment of "Done" product at the end of each sprint.
    - A "Done" increment is required at the Sprint Review
    - Only members of the Development Team creates the Increment
    A) Development Teams have the following characteristics:
        + They are self-organizing. No one (not even the Scrum Master) tells the Development Team how to turn 
        Product Backlog into Increments of potentially releasable functionality.
        + Development Teams are cross-functional, with all the skills as a team necessary to create a product Increment
        + Accountability belongs to the Development Team as a whole

10. The Scrum Master
    - The Scrum Master is responsible for promoting and supporting Scrum as defined in the Scrum Guide
    - The Scrum Master is a servant-leader for the Scrum Team
    - Scrum Masters do this by helping everyone understands Scrum Theory practices, rules, and Values
    - The Scrum Master helps everyone change these interactions to maximize value created by the Scrum Team
    A) Scrum Master Service to the Product Owner
        + Ensuring that goals, scope, and product domain are understood by everyone on the Scrum Team
        + Facilitating Scrum events as respected or needed
        + Ensuring the Product Owner knows how to arrange the Product Backlog to maximize value
    B) Scrum Master Service to the Development Team
        + Helping the Development Team in self-organizing and cross-functionality
        + Removing impediments to the Development Team's progress
    C) Scrum Master Service to the Organization
        + Leading and coaching the organization in its Scrum adoption
        + Planning Scrum implementations within the organization
        
11. The Sprint
    - A time-box of one month or less during which a "Done", usable, potentially releasable product Increment is created
    - Sprints have consistent durations throughout a development effort.
    - A new sprint starts immediately after the conclusion of the previous Sprint.
    A) Sprints Contain and Consist of:
        + Sprint Planning
        + Daily Scrums
        + Development work
        + Sprint Review
        + Sprint Retrospective
    B) During the Sprint
        + No changes are made that would endanger the Sprint goals
        + Quality goals do not decrease
        + Scope may be clarified and re-negotiated between the Product Owner and Development Team as more is learned.
    C) Cancelling a Sprint
        + A sprint can be cancelled before the Sprint time-box is observers
        + Only the Product Owner has the authority to cancel the Sprint
    
12. Sprint Planning
    - The Work to be performed in the Sprint is planned at the Sprint Planning
    - This plan is created by the collaborative work of the entire Scrum Team
    A) Sprint Planning Ansers the Following:
        + What can be delivered in the Increment resulting from the upcoming Sprint?
        + How will the work needed to deliver the Increment be achieved?
    B) Topic one
        + What can be done this Sprint?
            1) The Development Team works to forecast the functionality that will be developed during the Sprint
            2) The Product Owner discusses the objective that the Sprint should achieve and the Product Backlog items that, if completed in the Sprint,
            would achieve the Sprint Goal.
            3) The entire Scrum Team collaborates on understanding the work of the Sprint
            4) The input to this meeting is the Product Backlog, the latest product Increment, projected capacity of the Development Team during
            the Sprint, and past performance of the Development Team.
            5) The number of items selected from the Product Backlog for the Sprint is solely up to the Development Team.
            6) Only the Development Team can assess what it can accomplish over the upcoming Sprint
    C) Topic Two
        + How will the chosen work get done?
            1) Having set the Sprint Goal and selected the Product Backlog items for the Sprint, the Development Team decides how it will build this
            functionality into a "Done" product Increment during the Sprint.
            2) The Product Backlog items selected for this Sprint plus the plan for delivering them is called the Sprint Backlog
            3) By the end of the Sprint Planning, the Development Team should be able to explain to the Product Owner and Scrum Master how it intends
            to work as a self-organizing team to accomplish the Sprint Goal and create the anticipated Increment.

13. Sprint Goal
    - The Sprint Goal is an objective set for the Sprint that can be met through the implementation of Product Backlog
    - Provides guidance to the Development Team on why it is building the Increment.
    - In order to satisfy the Sprint Goal, it implements functionality and technology
    - If the work turns out to be different than the Development Team expected, they collaborate with the Product Owner to negotiate the scope
    of Sprint Backlog within the Sprint.

14. Daily Scrum
    - The Daily Scrum is a 15-minute time-boxed event for the Development Team
    - The Daily Scrum is held every day of the Sprint
    - The Development Team plans work for the next 24 hours at this event
    - The Daily Scrum is held at the same time and place each day to reduct complexity
    - The structure of the meeting is set by the Development Team and can be conducted in different ways if it focuses on progress toward the Sprint Goal
    A) Example: 
        + What did I do yesterday that helped the Development Team meet the Sprint Goal?
        + What will I do today to help the Development Team meet the Sprint Goal?
        + Do I see any impediment that prevents me or the Development Team from the Sprint Goal?
    B) Scrum Master
        + ensures that the Developemt Team has the meeting, but the Development Team is responsible for conducting the Daily Scrum within the 15-min time-box

15. Sprint Review
    - The Sprint is held at the end of the Sprint to inspect the Increment and adapt the Product Backlog if needed
    - During the Sprint Review, the Scrum Team and stakeholders collaborate about what was done in the Sprint
    - Based on that and any changes to the Product Backlog during the Sprint, attendees collaborate on the next things that could be done to Optimize value
    A) The Sprint Review includes the following elements:
        + Attendees include the Scrum Team and key stakeholders invited by the Product Owner
        + The Product Owner explains what Product Backlog items have been "Done" and what has not been "Done"
        + The Development Team discusses what went well during the Sprint, what problems it ran into, and how those problems were solved
        + The Development Team demonstrates the work that it has "Done" and answers questions about the Increment
        + The Product Owner discusses the Product Backlog as it stands. He or she projects likely target and delivery dates based on progres to date(if needed).
        + The entire group collaborates on what to do next, so that the Sprint Review provides valuable input to subsequent Sprint Planning
        + Review of the timeline, budget, potential capabilities, and marketplace for the next anticipated releases of functionality or capability of the product. 

16. Sprint Retrospective
    - An opportunity for the Scrum Team to inspect itself and create a plan for improvements to be enacted during the next sprint
    - The Scrum Master ensures that the event takes place and that attendants understand its Purpose
    A) The Purpose of the Sprint Retrospective is to:
        + Inspect how the last Sprint went with regards to people, relationships, process, and tools
        + Identify and order the major items that went well and potential improvements
        + Create a plan for implementing improvements to the way the Scrum Team does its work

17. Scrum artificats
    - Scrum's artifacts represent work or value to provide transparency and opportunities for inspection and adaptation
    - Artifacts defined by Scrum are specifically designed to maximize transparency of key information so that everybody has the same understanding of the artifact

18. Product Backlog
    - An ordered list of everything that is known to be needed in the product.
    - It is the single source of requirements for any changes to be made to the product
    - The Product Owner is responsible for the Product Backlog, including its content, availability, and Ordering
    - The Product Backlog lists all features, functions, requirments, enhancements, and fixes that constitute the changes to be made to the product in future releases.
    - Product Backlog items have the attributes of a description, order, estimate, and value.
    - The Development Team is responsible for all estimates, the people who will perform the work make the final estimate.

19. Sprint Backlog
    - The Sprint backlog is the set of Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint, plus a plan for delivering the product Increment and realizing the Sprint Goal.
    - The Sprint Backlog makes visible all the work that the Development Team identifies as necessary to meet the Sprint Goal.
    - As new work is required, the Development Team adds it to the SPrint Backlog.
    - Only the Development Team can change its Sprint Backlog during a Sprint

20. Increment
    - The Increment is the sum of all the Product Backlog items completed during a Sprint and the value of the increments of all previous Sprints.
    - At the end of a Sprint, the new Increment must be "Done" which means it must be in useable condition and meet the Scrum Team's definition of "Done"
    - The Increment must be in useable Condition regardless of whether the Product Owner decides to release it.

21. Definition of "Done"
    - When Product Backlog item or an Increment is described as "Done", everyone must understand what "Done" means.
    - The Definition of "Done" for the Scrum Team and is used to asses when work is complete on the product Increment.
    - As Scrum Teams mature, it is expected that their definitions of "Done" will expand to include more stringent criteria for higher Quality.
    - Any one product or system should have a definition of "Done" that is a standard for any work done on it.
