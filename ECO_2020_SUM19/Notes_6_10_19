The Three Basic Questions:
    1. What will be produced?
    2. How will items be produced?
    3. For whom will it be produced?

I. Two Opposing Sets of Answers
    1. Centralized Command and Control:
        - Also called a command and control system, this system has a centralized authority that decides what items to produce and how many each,
        determines how the scarce resources will be organized in the items' production, and it identifies who will be able to obtain the items.
    2. The Price System:
        - Also called a market system, a price system is an economic system that answers the three basic questions using decentralized decision making.
        - In a pure price system, individuals own all of the scarce resources used in production.
        - This means those choices about what and how many of each item to produce are made by private parties on their own initiative, as are the decisions
            about how to produce those  items.
        - Finally, individuals and families choose how to allocate their incomes to obtain those items at price established by privately organized mechanisms.
        - Those prices in turn signal everyone in a price system relative scarcity of different resources, which in turn provides information about what and
            how many items to produce, how to produce each, and who will choose to buy items.
    3. Mixed Economic Systems:
        - The economic systems of the world incorporate aspects of both centralized command and control and the decentralized price systems.

II. Basic Principles of Economics
    1. Rationality
        - Individuals will not intentionally make decisions that would leave them or possibly someone wlse worse off.
        - Someone is rational if their actions optimize the expected impacts of the actions given the information a person may have available.
        - What may seem irrational is simply an action based on lack of information or the existence of alternative or unknown incentives.
        A) Example:
            + I wake up in the morning and need some energy. I should probably not eat a full turkey dinner. Maybe coffee or tea or something with caffeine.
    2. Incentives or Goals
        - People respond to Incentives
        - These incentives may be moral (I should do what is "right")
        - Philanthropic (I want to make society better)
        - Economic (based on income/price, rates of return)
        - Behavior may be driven by a competitive nature to look as successful as others, or to be accepted by others.
        - Capitalism and rewards for innovation
        - Government created a patent system to enhance the rewards and hence the incentives of innovation.
    3. Scarcity
        - The quantity demanded for a good exceeds the quantity supplied when price is zero.
        - Implies positive price exists for a scarce good. 
    4. Opportunity costs
        - In production/supply - in consumption
            + If effort was put into producing a particular good, good x, how many units of good y could have been produced with the same effort.
            + The Opportunity cost is the amount of the other good that was forgone in production.
        - Consumption:
            + If a given amount of income was spent on good x, how many units of the next most desired good could the consumer have purchased?
            + The Opportunity cost could in this instance can be measured, if possible, by the amount of satisfaction received or traded off by consuming good x
                rather than good y.
    5. Marginalism
        - Can be described as "What happens next."
        - Marginalism implies the use of a first derivative.
        - The decision to buy only 14 prounds of fudge in Estes Park is influced by the fact that the "extra" fifteenth pound could make you severely ill or more generally;
            the benefits to you of the extra or marginal pound are less than the costs of purchasing (the price of) the extra pound.
        - We are therefore interested in the benefits and costs of an action, "at the margin."
    6. The Market and Trade (Sort of the 6th principle)
