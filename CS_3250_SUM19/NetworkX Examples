I. Creating a Graph
    - Create an empty graph with no nodes and no edges.

        >>> import networkx as nx
        >>> G = nx.Graph()

    - By definition, a Graph is a collection of nodes (vertices) along with identified pairs of nodes (called edges, links, etc).
    - In NetworkX, nodes can be any hashable object e.g., a text string, an image, an XML object, another Graph, a customized node object, etc.
    - Note:
        + Python’s None object should not be used as a node as it determines whether optional function arguments have been assigned in many functions.
II. Nodes
    - The graph G can be grown in several ways. NetworkX includes many graph generator functions and facilities to read and write graphs in many formats.
    - To get started though we’ll look at simple manipulations. You can add one node at a time.

        >>> G.add_node(1)

    - To add a list of nodes

        >>> G.add_nodes_from([2, 3])

    - Or add any iterable container of nodes.
    - You can also add nodes along with node attributes if your container yields 2-tuples (node, node_attribute_dict). 
    - Node attributes are discussed further below.

        >>> H = nx.path_graph(10)
        >>> G.add_nodes_from(H)

    - Note:
        + That G now contains the nodes of H as nodes of G. 
        + In contrast, you could use the graph H as a node in G.

        >>> G.add_node(H)

    - The graph G now contains H as a node.
    - This flexibility is very powerful as it allows graphs of graphs, graphs of files, graphs of functions and much more.
    - It is worth thinking about how to structure your application so that the nodes are useful entities. 
    - Of course you can always use a unique identifier in G and have a separate dictionary keyed by identifier to the node information if you prefer.
    - Note:
        + You should not change the node object if the hash depends on its contents.
III. Edges
    - G can also be grown by adding one edge at a time,

        >>> G.add_edge(1, 2)
        >>> e = (2, 3)
        >>> G.add_edge(*e)  # unpack edge tuple*
        
    - By adding a list of edges,

        >>> G.add_edges_from([(1, 2), (1, 3)])

    - Or by adding any ebunch of edges. 
    - An ebunch is any iterable container of edge-tuples.
    - An edge-tuple can be a 2-tuple of nodes or a 3-tuple with 2 nodes followed by an edge attribute dictionary
    - Example:
        + (2, 3, {'weight': 3.1415}). 
        + Edge attributes are discussed further below

        >>> G.add_edges_from(H.edges)
    
    - There are no complaints when adding existing nodes or edges.
    - For example
        + after removing all nodes and edges,

        >>> G.clear()

    - We add new nodes/edges and NetworkX quietly ignores any that are already present.

        >>> G.add_edges_from([(1, 2), (1, 3)])
        >>> G.add_node(1)
        >>> G.add_edge(1, 2)
        >>> G.add_node("spam")        # adds node "spam"
        >>> G.add_nodes_from("spam")  # adds 4 nodes: 's', 'p', 'a', 'm'
        >>> G.add_edge(3, 'm')
    
    - At this stage the graph G consists of 8 nodes and 3 edges, as can be seen by:

        >>> G.number_of_nodes()
        8
        >>> G.number_of_edges()
        3

    - We can examine the nodes and edges.
    - Four basic graph properties facilitate reporting:
        + G.nodes
        + G.edges
        + G.adj 
        + G.degree 
    - These are set-like views of the nodes, edges, neighbors (adjacencies), and degrees of nodes in a graph.
    - They offer a continually updated read-only view into the graph structure.
    - They are also dict-like in that you can look up node and edge data attributes via the views and iterate with data attributes using methods
        + .items()
        + .data('span')
    - If you want a specific container type instead of a view, you can specify one.
    - Here we use lists, though sets, dicts, tuples and other containers may be better in other contexts.

        >>> list(G.nodes)
        [1, 2, 3, 'spam', 's', 'p', 'a', 'm']
        >>> list(G.edges)
        [(1, 2), (1, 3), (3, 'm')]
        >>> list(G.adj[1])  # or list(G.neighbors(1))
        [2, 3]
        >>> G.degree[1]  # the number of edges incident to 1
        2

    - One can specify to report the edges and degree from a subset of all nodes using an nbunch.
    - An nbunch is any of: 
        + None (meaning all nodes)
        + A node
        + An iterable container of nodes that is not itself a node in the graph.

        >>> G.edges([2, 'm'])
        EdgeDataView([(2, 1), ('m', 3)])
        >>> G.degree([2, 3])
        DegreeView({2: 1, 3: 2})

    - One can remove nodes and edges from the graph in a similar fashion to adding.
    - Use methods:
        + Graph.remove_node() 
        + Graph.remove_nodes_from()
        + Graph.remove_edge()
        + Graph.remove_edges_from()

        >>> G.remove_node(2)
        >>> G.remove_nodes_from("spam")
        >>> list(G.nodes)
        [1, 3, 'spam']
        >>> G.remove_edge(1, 3)

    - When creating a graph structure by instantiating one of the graph classes you can specify data in several formats.

        >>> G.add_edge(1, 2)
        >>> H = nx.DiGraph(G)   # create a DiGraph using the connections from G
        >>> list(H.edges())
        [(1, 2), (2, 1)]
        >>> edgelist = [(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3)]
        >>> H = nx.Graph(edgelist)

IV. What to use as Nodes and Edges
    - You might notice that nodes and edges are not specified as NetworkX objects. 
    - This leaves you free to use meaningful items as nodes and edges. 
    - The most common choices are:
        + numbers or strings
        + Any hashable object (except None)
        + An edge can be associated with any object x using:
            
             G.add_edge(n1, n2, object=x).

    - As an example:
        + n1 and n2 could be protein objects from the RCSB Protein Data Bank
        + x could refer to an XML record of publications detailing experimental observations of their interaction.
