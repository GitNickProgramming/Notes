VII. Databases 
    - Databases store large amounts of data 
    - Businesses require databases for:
        * Inventory
        * Personnel
        * Customers
        * Suppliers 
        * Financials 
    - Data Organization:
        * Bits and Bytes:
            + Basic pieces of computer data 
        * Field:
            + One meaningful piece of information 
        * Record: 
            + A Set of related fields 
        * Data file:
            + A set of related records 
        * Database:
            + a set of related data files 
    - Database Management system (DBMS)
        * Manages files in a database 
    - Relational database model:
        * Files are 2-d tables 
            + Entity: a distinguishable component of system
                ~ An employee, a customer, or a rug for sale 
            + Tuple: a row of a relational table 
            + Attribute: a category of a field 
            + Primary key: attribute(s) that uniquely identify a tuple 
    - SQL (Structure Query language)
        * Standard query language for DBMS 
        * Use SQL queries to retrieve data according to some criteria
        * Example 1:
            + Retrieve employee name, pay rate, and hours worked for employees named Perreira 
    - Multiple tables may contain related data:
        * Example:
            + Insurance policies for Rugs-for-You 
        * Foreign key:
            + An attribute in one table that is the key in another 
                ~ Connects data in one table with another 
                ~ Example: EmployeeID
    - Database Integrity:
        * Verification as data is added/Removed 
            + Entity integrity:
                ~ No Primary key can be missing 
            + Data Integrity:
                ~ Values must match category constraints (e.g., be a valid pay rate)
            + Regerential Integrity:
                ~ Foreign keys must match a primary key value in the related table 
    - Efficiency:
        + Disk access is slow
        + File management system can organize disk files for faster access 
    - Distributed database:
        + data stored across a computer network 
VIII. Data Science 
    - Big data:
        * Huge amounts of available data 
    - Data Analysis:
        * Process of finding the right data sets
        * Putting data in the right format
        * Writing queries to extract information 
    - Data Science:
        * Incorporates data analysis task, but requires knowledge of the enterprise for useful queries and the use
        of statistics and visualization techniques to interpret the results.
        * Predict future strategies to achieve a predetermined goal 
    - Data warehouse:
        * A collection of databases that contain current and archived data for research and analysis 
    - Data Mining:
        * Process of analyzing data to extract and interpret previously hidden patterns through several steps
            + Determine the problem to be solved 
            + Review the condition of the data:
                ~ Does all the data have the same structure?
                ~ Are any tuples missing information?
            + Determine a model that will help bring out the patterns:
                ~ Patterns classify the data to determine the strongest predictors of a given outcome
                ~ This is the data mining part: creation of a model 
            + Evaluate your model:
                ~ Are the results predicted borne out by further data? 
                ~ Would a different model give better results?
    - Privacy issues associated with data mining 
        * Automatically analyzing large amounts of data to uncover hidden patterns (famous target case) 
    - Data Brokers:
        * Companies that collect and sell data such as:
            + Birth Certificats
            + Marriage certificates
            + Publicly available information
            + Nonpublic data purchases or acquired from other companies or data brokers 
    - Nonetheless, data science makes contributions to
        * Medicine 
        * Science 
        * Ecology 
        * And many more fields 
IX: Summary
    - Ecommerce is a central part of our economy
    - Businesses deciding to enter the online world must plan carefully
    - Ecommerce web design is complicated
    - Ecommerce requires integrating multiple computer system:
        * Inventory 
        * Accounting
        * Suppliers 
        * Etc. 
    - Databases are systems to store large amounts of data 
    - Data is organized into fields, records, data files, and databases 
    - DBMS Manages files of databases 
    - The relational database model is the most common:
        * Records Represent entities
        * All data is viewed as set of 2-d tables 
    - SQL is the most common query language for retrieving data from a DBMS 
    - Databases must ensure integrity, efficiency, and (sometimes) distributed access to data
    - Data mining discovers midden patterns in a big data set 
    - Privacy issues arise due to data mining techniques
