60 Markets: Perfect Competition
I. Long Run in Perfect Competition
    - In the long run, firms are able to exit or enter the industry bases on whether they can cover costs.
    - Firms can also change the scale of production and move to a new short run cost curve.
    - What happen if supernormal profits or positive economic are made?
        ~ If supernormal profits are made new firms will be attracted into the industry causing prices to fall.
        ~ If firms are making a loss then firms will leave the industry causing price to rise.
    - Firms are producing at the absolute minimum of the average total cost curve.
    - Costs may be different due to:
        ~ Differences in scale 
        ~ Differences in management 
        ~ Different locations
        ~ And so on
    - The lowest cost firms may be able to make a profit when other firms are earning an exonomic loss.
II. The Desirability of Perfect competition
    - The market is efficient and equitable
        ~ The price charged to individuals equals the marginal cost of production to each firm.
        ~ P = MC >> efficiency, the market is pricing the product such that the price equals the cost to society of
        producing the last good sold on the market.
        ~ The price charged to individuals equals the average cost of production to each firm.
        ~ P = ATC >> equity, the market is pricing the product such that the price equals ATC generating a fiar rate of return,
        equal to firm opportunity costs.
    - Output produced under a perfectly competitive market structure is larger than other markets organizations.
    - The sum of producer and consumer surplus is maximized.

62 Markets: Monopoly
I. Monopoply Characteristics
    - One firm
    - Very high barriers
    - A Unique Product 
    - Very little nonprice competition
II. Causes of Monopolies
    - Government mandated/gov't regulation 
    - A Firm has control of needed inputs
    - A Firm controls the production process
    - Economic/high start up costs leadings to substantial economies of scale- It is often natural for only one firm to produce
    all the goods in the market- this is the special case of a natural monopoly 
III. Important Concepts
    - The Realtion between MR and P for a monopolist
    - In order for the firm to be considered a monopoly, the product it sells must have no close substitutes available from other
    firms.
IV. Price Discrimination:
    - The firm charges different prices to different consumers for the same good:
        ~ Charging customers different prices for the same product.
        ~ Charging customers a price depending on the quantity
    - It is also possible to charge different consumers different prices based on the timing of the purchase, in this case the product
    is not exactly identical.
    - This could be a form of differential pricing.
    - Examples of Price Discrimination:
        ~ There are industries that conduct a substantial portion of their business using price discrimination:
            + Travel industry
                * Airlines and other travel companies use differentiated pricing often.
                * Travel products and services are marketed to specific social segments.
                * Airlines usually assign specific capacity to various booking classes.
                * Prices fluctuate based on time of travel (time of day, day of the week, time of the year)
                * Prices fluctuate between companies as well as within each company.
            + Pharmaceutical Industry:
                * Price discrimination is common in the pharmaceutical industry.
                * Drug-makers charge more for drugs in wealthier countries.
                * Drug prices in the United States are some of the highest in the world.
                * Europeans, on average, pay only 56% OF WHAT aMERICANS PAY FOR THE SAME PRESCRIPTION DRUGS.
            + Textbooks (physical ones, not your boundless book)
                * Price discrimination is also prevalent within the publishing industry.
                * Textbooks are much higher in the United States despite the fact that they are produced in the country.
                * Copyright protection laws increase the price of textbooks.
                * Textbooks are mandatory in the united States while schools in other counries see them as study aids.
    - Methods of Price Discrimination include:
        ~ Coupons:
            + Coupons are used to distinguish consumers by their reserve price.
            + Companies increase the price of a good and individuals who are not price sensitive will pay the higher price.
            + Coupons allow price sensitive consumers to receive a discount.
            + At the same time the seller is still making increased revenue.
        ~ Age Discounts:
            + Age discounts are a form of price discrimination where the price of a good or admission to an event is based on age.
            + Age discounts are usually broken down by child, student, adult, and senior.
            + In some cases, Children under a certain age are given free admission or eat for free.
            + Places where age discounts are given include reastaurants, movies, and other forms of entertainment.
        ~ Occupational Discounts:
            + Price discrimination is present when individuals receive certain discounts based on their occupation.
            + An example is when active military members receive discounts.
        ~ Retail incentives:
            + This includes rebates, discount coupons, bulk and quantity pricing, seasonal discounts, and frequent buy discounts.
        ~ Gender based prices:
            + In certain markets prices are set based on gender.
            + For example, a Ladies Night at a bar is a form of price discrimination.
    - Price Discrimination: Robinson-Patman Violations
        ~ The Supreme Court has ruled that price discrimination claims under the Robinson-Patman Act should be evaluated conistent with
        broader antitrust policies.
        ~ In Practice, Robinson-Patman claims must meet several specific legal test 
    - Essentially there are TWO MAIN CONDITIONS required for discriminatory price.
        ~ Differences in price elasticity of Demand Between Markets:
            + There must be a different price elasticity of demand from each group of consumers.
            + The firm is then able to charge a higher price to the group with a more price inelastic demand and a relatively lower price
            to the price to the group with a more eleastic demand.
            + By adopting such a strategy, the firm can increase its total revenue and profits (i.e. achieve a higher lvl of producer surplus)
        ~ An ability to segment or subdivide the market. There are barriers to prevent consumers switching from one supplier to another.
            + The firm must be able to prevent "market seepage" or "consumer switching"
            + Defined as a process whereby consumers who have purchsed a good or service at a lower price are able to re-sell it to the consumer
            who would have normally paid the expensive price.
            + This can be done in a number of ways, and is probably easier to achieve with the provision of a unique service such as a haircut
            rather than with exchange of tangible goods.
            + Seepage might be prevented by selling a product to consumers at unique and different points in time.
            + For example, with the use of time specific airline tickets that cannot be resold under any circumstances.
            + The firm must be able to split the market into different sub-groups of consumers and then prevent the good or service being 
            resold between consumers. 
            + For example a rail operator must make it impossible for someone paying a "cheap fare" to resell to someone expected to pay a higher fare.
            + This is easier in the provision of services rather than goods.
            + The costs of separating the market and selling to different sub-groups (or market segments) must not be prohibitive.
V. Types of Discrimination:
    - First Degree:
        ~ A monopolist that engages in first-degree price discrimination absorbs all consumers surplus.
        ~ Negotiates with consumers for each good sold.
        ~ Sometimes known as optimal pricing
        ~ Perfect 1st degree prce discrimination
            + The firm separates the whole market into each individual consumer and charges each consumer the price they are willing and able to pay.
        ~ This is impossible to achieve unless the firm knows every consumer's preferences and, as a result, is unlikely to occur in the real world.
        ~ The Transactions cost involved in finding out through market research what each buyer is prepared to pay is the main block or barriers
        to a business(es) engaging in this form of price discrimination.
        ~ If the monopolist is able to perfectly segment the market, then the average revenue curve effectively becomes the marginal
        revenue curve for the firm.
        ~ The Monopolist will continue to sell extra units as long as the extra evenue exceeds the marginal cost of production.
    - Second Degree (based on Quantities)
        ~ The firm separates the market according to output, regardless of timing.
        ~ The firm charges different prices for different blocks of goods.
            + The first 10 purchases, the next ten, etc. 
            + Seats on a plane, sale merchandise.
        ~ This type of price discrimination involves businesses selling off packages of a product deemed to be surplus capacity at lower prices than 
        the previously published/advertised price.
    - Third Degree:
        ~ Separate market into different customer groups or groups of people:
            + Business vs. Nonbusiness
            + By geography
            + By insured vs. noninsured
            + By time... Peak vs. Nonpeak
        ~ Third degree involves charging different prices for the same product in different consumer segments of the market.
        ~ The key is that third degree discrimination is linked directly to consumers' willingness and ability to pay for a good or service.
        ~ It means that the prices charged may bear little or no relation to the cost of production and may be independent of time.
VI. The Aims/Goals of price discrimination:
    - It must be remembered that the main aim of price discrimination is to increase the total revenue and/or profits of the supplier!
    - It helps them to off-load excess capacity and can aslo be used as a technique to take market share away from rival firms
