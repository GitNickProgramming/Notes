I. Supplyand Demand & Governement Policy
    - Price Ceiling
        + The governement sets a price such that the market price cannot go above it.
        + A belief that the market price is too high. To be effective it must be below
            the market price.
    - Price Floor
        + The Government sets a price such that the market price cannot go below it.
        + The market price is believed too low.
    - Economic Incidence
        + Who ultimately pays the tax via higher price or less revenue/lower price 
    - Legislative incidence
        + Who is the tax levied on?
        + Who has to write the check to the governement 
    - How taxes on sellers affect market outcomes
        + Immediate impact on sellers: shifts in Supply
        + Supply curve shifts left
        + Higher equilibrium price
        + Lower equilibrium quantity 
        + The tax reduces the size of the market 
    - Summary:
        + Taxes Discourage market activity 
        + Buyers and sellers share the burden of tax 
        + Buyers receive less, are worse off 
        + Get the higher price but pay the tax
        + Overall: Effective price fall
    - Now tax the Consumer
        + Initial impact on the demand 
        + Demand curve shifts left 
        + Lower equilibrium price 
        + Lower equilibrium quantity 
        + The tax reduces the size of the market 
    - Taxes levied on sellers and taxes levied on buyers are equivalent 
    - Wedge between the price that buys pay and the price that sellers receive 
    - The same, regardless of whether the tax levied on buyers or sellers 
    - Shifts the relative position of the supply and demand curves 
    - Buyers and sellers share the tax burden 
    - Elasticity and Tax incidence 
        + For very elastic supply and relatively inelastic demand 
        + Sellers bear a small burden of tax 
        + Buyers bear most of the burden
    - For Relatively inelastic suppy and very elastic demand 
        + Sellers bear most of the tax burden 
        + Buyers bear a small burden 
    - The supply curve is elastic, and the demand curve is inelastic 
    - In this case, the price received by sellers falls only slightly, while the price paid
        by buyers rises substantially
    - Thus, buyers bear most of the burden of the tax 
    - The supply curve is inelastic, and the demand curve is elastic
        + In this case, the price received by sellers fall substantially, while the price paid
            by buyers rises only slightly.
        + Thus, sellers bear most of the burden of the tax 
    - Tax Burden 
        + Falls more heavily on the side of the market that is less elastic
        + Small elasticity of demand 
        + Buyers do not have good alternatives to consuming this good 
        + Small elasticity of supply 
        + Sellers do not have good alternatives to producing this good 
    - In 1990s, Congress adopted a new luxury tax 
        + On yachts, private airplanes, furs, jewelry, expensive cars 
        + Goal:
            * To raise revenue from those who could most easily afford to pay 
    - Luxury Items 
        + Demand is quite elastic 
        + Supply is relatively inelastic 
    - Outcome:
        + Burden of a tax falls largely on the suppliers
        + Relatively inelastic suppy 
        + 1993: most of the luxury tax repealed
    - Example:
        + Payroll taxes are taxes paid on te wages and salaries of employees. These taxes are used to fiance social insurance programs
        + The largest of these social insurance taxes are the two federal payroll taxes, which sow up as FICA 
            and MEDFICA on your pay stub.
        + The first is a 12.4 percent tax to fund social security, and the second is a 2.9 percent tax to fund Medicare
            for a combined rate of 15.3 percent 
        + Half of payroll taxes (7.65 percent) are remitted directly by employers, while the other half (7.65%)
            are take out of workers' paychecks
        + Employees effectively pay almost the entire payroll tax, instead of splitting the burden with their employers 
            + This is because tax incidence is not determined by law, but by markets. The marketplace decides how the tax burden is divided
                between buyers and sellers, based on which party is more sensitive to change in prices (i.e. more price elastic)
        + It turns out that supply of labor - that is, workers' willingness to work - is much less sensitive to taxes than the demand for labor 
            or employers' willingness to hire.
    - Lawmakers
        + Can decide whether a tax comes from the buyer's pocket or from the seller's
        + Cannot legislate the true burden of a tax. Tax incidence 
        + Incidence is determined by the forces of supply and demand
