II. Introduction
    - Social and Ethical Issues related to information technology are unavoidable.
        * Just because we can, doesn't mean we should.
    - Develop skills to reason about such issues.
        * Learn about morality and ethics in the digital space.
    - Case studies introduce important ethical issues.
        * Describe arguments for and against certain positions.
        * Evaluate arguments in terms of ethics.
III. Case studies #1
    - Case 1: Is sharing Good?
        * Napster file-sharing system was developed (1999)
        * Peer-to-peer file sharing.
            ~ Software introduces users to each other.
            ~ Sharing happens directly between users.
        * Recording companies filed suit against Napster, 1999
        * Lawsuit claimed Napster was a conspiracy to encourage mass infringement of copyright.
        * Facts:
            ~ Most shared music was copyrighted 
            ~ Many artists opposed sharing (No revenue for them)
            ~ Some artists supported sharing.
        * Napster Claims:
            ~ Napster reported song ocations, not involved in actual sharing.
            ~ They were not responsible for users' behaviors.
            ~ Swapping files this way should be "fair use" under copyright law.
        * Napster lost the case and appeals, and closed in 2001
            ~ Sharing movies, legally or not, is a growing issue.
        * Sharing movies, legally or not, is a growing issue.
        * Downloading Images from the web for personal use
        * Ethical (not legal) questions
            ~ Is it right to swap copyrighted music files?
            ~ Is it right to provide a search engine to enable users to search each other's databases for copyrighted materials?
            ~ Ethics:
                + The study of how to decide if something is morally right or wrong.
                + How do we judge right or wrong?
            ~ Consequentialism
                + Focuses on the consequences of an act - on the whole good or bad outcomes.
            ~ Utilitarianism:
                + look at overall good for everyone.
    - Utilitarian Argument #1
        * Copying is Ok:
            ~ There are many more music users than publishers.
            ~ Music users are happy to get free access.
            ~ Publishers get publicity for their products.
            ~ File Sharing is akin to hearing a song on the radio.
            ~ Drop in sales may relate more to purchasing song-by-song rather than by album.
    - Utilitarian Argument #2
        * Copying is not OK:
            ~ Early on MP3 sharing encouraged CS Sales, but long-term trend is reduction in sales.
            ~ iTunes and Amazon sell one song at a time to compete with illegal file sharing.
            ~ If publishers cannot profit, then less music will be made.
            ~ Copy right protection is the law, and music file sharing is clearly illegal.
            ~ Encouraging Illegal behavior is wrong.
    - Dialectic:
        * A dialouge that explores an issue from both sides to lead to greater understanding.
        * Example:
            ~ Facts are that music sales have dropped continuously.
            ~ Long-term, argument that less music would be published is a strong one.
            ~ Lesser-Knwon artits may use file sharing to become better known, depend on income from performances.
            ~ Rethink the music industry from a new viewpoint.
IV. Case Studies #2
    - The Athens Affair: Privacy vs. Security 
        * Law enforcement needs to wiretap phones belonging to suspects.
            ~ Prior to cellular technology, a wiretap was a literal split off the main phone wire into the building.
        * Modern use of cell phones and VoIP complicates phone taps.
        * However, most/all phone calls go through computer systems.
        * Laws require all telecommuications to support "lawful intercept"
            ~ LI systems for wiretaps.
        * Built-in LI systems are a target for hackers.
        * In Greece
            ~ Hackers wiretapped 100 major business and political leaders.
            ~ No Trace of who did it or why 
            ~ Ethical question 
                + How does the decision to require LI software impact privacy and security?
    - Ethical Reasoning By Analogy 
        * Analogy-making is familiar to everyone.
        * Analogies are never perfect:
            ~ What aspects are important?
        * Apply decisions from one problem to another.
            ~ Identify what doesn't fit
            ~ Often important aspect of the problem.
        * Analogy #1:
            ~ LI is like requiring everyone to record their face-to-face conversations.
                + Focused on VoIP (e.g. Skype)
                + Similarities between VoIP and face-to-face:
                    >> Forms of communication
                    >> Meant to include a limited number.
                    >> Possible for others to listen in.
                    >> Easy access for others: required recordings allow abouses by government or hackers.
                + Decisions about face-to-face conversations
                    >> Private conversations are not monitored routinely.
                    >> Monitoring only with court order and probable cause.
                    >> We do NOT record all conversations all the time.
                + Implications by analogy for VoIP:
                    >> LI systems go beyond rules for private conversations.
                    >> Without LI, Law enforcement can still monitor as with face-to-face conversations.
        * Problem With Analogy 
            ~ This arugment would apply to normal phone tapping.
            ~ Society accepts the need for some phone taps.
            ~ What features of the analogy don't work?
            ~ Fourth pary involvement:
                + Telecommunications provider.
        * An analogy that includes a middleman is needed.
        * Analogy #2:
            ~ LI is like suspicious activity reporting (SAR) in banking.
                + U.S. Banks must notify government when they see suspicious transactions.
                + Similarities between LI and SAR 
                    >> Both are critical resources for criminals and require the help of external (law-abiding) entity.
                    >> Information helps to connect Suspects with each other and discover networks of suspects.
            ~ Problems with the Analogy:
                + Who initiates the sending of information differs (banks initiate, not governemnt)
                + The Information provided is very different.
                    >> Banks provide times, dates, and participants.
                    >> Full conversations recording supplies much more detail.
            ~ Decision about suspicious activity reporting.
                + Banks should be required to report suspicious activity.
            ~ Implications by analogy:
                + Telecom Companies should be required to report suspicious activity.
            ~ Supports storage of detailed call records.
            ~ Does not support storage of whole converstations.
        * After Analyzing the Analogies, consider three possible options/solutions:
            ~ Require all VoIP systems to implement LI.
            ~ Do not require LI: Use Physical eavesdropping.
            ~ Require VoIP providers to report suspicious activities, but do not record conversations.
        * Interested parties:
            ~ Law enforcement:
                + Monitoring saves time and money; can do job better.
            ~ Hackers and non-hacker criminals 
            ~ The public:
                + Monitoring helps law enforcement, but decreases privacy and perhaps safety.
        * Utilitarian Analysis
            ~ Law Enforcement:
                + Option 1 is best.
            ~ The Public:
                + Option 2 reduces police effectiveness.
                + Option 1 allows for abuses.
                + Option 3 may also reduce police effectiveness.
V. Case Studies #3
    - Hackers: Public Enemies or Gadflies?
        * People who break int computer systems, launch internet worms and viruses, vandalize websites, etc.
        * Some hackers are clearly criminals:
            ~ Purposeless vandalism
            ~ Identity theft
            ~ Outright theft
        * Some hackers engage in "hacktivism"
            ~ Can hacking a computer be a social good?
    - WikiLeaks:
        * Protects government and corporate whistle-blowers.
        * Provides a secure way to share sensitive documents anonymously.
        * U.S diplomatic cables.
        * One million confidential/secret U.S. government documents
        * WikiLeaks is a public corporation with known leadership.
    - Anonymous:
        * Primarily interested in freedom of speech.
        * No official leader or organizing body.
        * Amorphous, secret membership.
        * DOS attack in retribution for sanctions against WikiLeaks.
        * Attacks on government sites Tunisia, Egypt, Libya.
        * Publication of emails from corporations.
    - Analogy:
        * Breaking into a computer is like breaking int someone's house.
            ~ Similarities:
                + Intruders are there without permission
                + Owners take precautions to discourage intrusion.
                + Both are against the law.
            ~ Differences:
                + Burglars take physical objects, depriving owner.
                + Hackers, in this case, copy intellectual property.
                + No threat of violence with hacking.
    - Utilitarian arguments:
        * Owner of information loses control over it.
        * Hackers gain access to information.
        * Owner must increase security.
            ~ Increased awareness of vulnerability may be good.
            ~ Increased security only required because of hackers.
        * Hard to see consequiences.
        * Must we distinguish between "good hackers" and "bad hackers"?
    - Deontological Arguments:
        * Deontology:
            ~ The study of duty and obligation.
        * Focuses on Duties of actor and effect on other's rights. 
        * Categorical Imperative (Kant):
            ~ Never treat a fellow human merely as a means to an end.
        * Focus on intent of an action, not consequences.
        * Hackers for personal gain are unethical; ignore them.
        * Focus on hackers who claim benign intent.
    - Parts of the Hacker ethic (Steven Levy)
        * "All Information should be free"
            ~ To make decisions, people need good information.
            ~ Hackers should walways spread information.
        * "Mistrust authority-promote decentralization"
            ~ Bureaucracies and rules prevent things from getting done.
            ~ Each hacker should individually as he or she sees best.
    - Ethical Critique of Hacker Ethic:
        * The information being shared does not belong to the hackers.
        * Does not respect other people's wishes or safety.
        * Rules exist because we, as a society, expect electronic privacy.
        * Why should their ethic override other's wishes?
        * Does hacking treat other people as a means to an end?
VI. Case Studies: Thinking Straight about Technology and Ethics
    - "Paramedic ethics:" 
        * Know a little and know when to ask.
        * Ask these questions when facing an ethical problem:
            ~ Who are the stakeholders in this situation?
            ~ What does each stakeholder have to gain or lose?
            ~ What duties and responsibilities are important?
            ~ Can you think of an analogous situation?
            ~ Does it clarify the situation?
                + Make a decision or repoeat in dialectic form
VII. Case Studies #4
    - Genetic Information and Medical Research
        * Fictional ethical situation:
            ~ Faimily doctor asks you to participate in a sutdy of genetic diversity and disease by donating some skin cells.
            ~ Cells are identified by a randomly assigned number and your zip code. Should you donate?
        * What are the stakeholders?
            ~ You 
            ~ Family doctor
            ~ Pharmaceutical company, "Pharm CO"
            ~ Skin cell donors to study, in general 
            ~ People with genetic disease
        * What is at Stake?
            ~ You lose a few skin cells 
            ~ Your Privacy:
                + Pharm CO may seek to learn your identity
                + Transmission of genetic data could be intercepted.
            ~ Your doctor might be paid for finding participants
            ~ Pharm Co may develop new drugs
            ~ Drugs could help people with genetic diseases
        * Identify duties and Responsibilities 
            ~ Doctor has a duty to treat you and protect your privacy.
            ~ You have a duty to pay the doctor and follow instructions.
            ~ Pharm CO has a duty to develop safe drugs.
            ~ Pharm CO has promised to pay doctors for finding participants.
            ~ Pharm CO has promized to respec you privacy.
        * More Complex duties and Responsibilities 
            ~ Should you get royalties if your information leads to a profitable drug?
            ~ Does Pharm CO own genetic information, or should it be shared freely?
            ~ Why is zip code part of encoding?
            ~ Do you have a duty to help cure disease?
    - Thank of Analogies:
        * Compare to Red Cross blood donations:
            ~ Both involve confidential health information.
            ~ Both ask for volunteer donors.
            ~ Both have collectors and users who are paid.
            ~ Both involve altruistic reasons for donation.
            ~ Blood is the valuable item; genetic information in cells is the value.
            ~ Company is driven by profit and loss
        - Compare to for-profit companies that solicit money for charity
            ~ Confidentiality is an issue for both
            ~ In both, volunteers are asked to donate by someone with financial interest in the donation.
            ~ Both involve altruistic motivations.
            ~ One involves donated money; the other does not.
            ~ Doctor and pharmaceutical roles don't quite match for-profit company.
    - Make a decision or loop again 
        * Must decide right now (while at the doctor)?
        * Should you do more research?
        * Should you ask others?
        * Might choose to decline unless you know more about Pharm CO's use of your information, especially given the financial interests of other stakeholders.
VIII. Personal Privacy and Social Networks
    - Apply the reasoning from case studies to more personal ethical issues.
    - Cyberbullying
        * Humilating, taunting, threatening, invading someone's privacy online.
    - Sextexting:
        * Sending sexually explicit messages or images using cell phones or tablet computers.
        * Privacy expectations for public postings to social networks.
    - Cyberbullying Examples:
        * Megan Meier commited suicide after being harassed on MySpace
            ~ Harasser was the mother of a former friend.
            ~ Information posted to Craigslist led to young girl receiving sexual phone calls and emails.
            ~ Tyler Clementi commited suicide after his roomate posted a recording of a sexual encounter with another man.
        * Laws lag behind the problem
        * First amendment protections complicate the issue
    - Sexting Between consenting adults is legal
        * Images intended to be private between two individuals may not stay that way.
        * Once something is posted on the internet, it is there forever.
    - Sexting involving minors may be considered child pornography, even if the perptrator is the "child"
        * Laws around minors sending other minors images have been relaxed in some states.
    - Privacy expectations with public postings online 
        * Student posted nasty story on MySpace about her hometown; she deleted it six days later.
        * Hometown high school principal saw the story, gave it to the local newspaper.
        * Newpaper printed it as a letter to the editor.
        * Faimly was threatened, lost business, had to move away.
    - Courts found that she should have no expectations of privacy when making a public posting on MySpace
    - Assume that anything sent or posted online:
        * May become widely distributed and public 
        * Will last forever
    - Don't Post something if:
        * You don't want a large number of people to see it.
        * You would be embarrassed to have it widely circulated (to parents, employers, etc.)
        * The material could be considered libelous or defamatory.
        * The information is private and a sexual nature.
IX. Fake News, Politics, and Social Media 
    - Fake news
        * Is news deliberately altered or fabricated with the intent of passing it off as valid.
    - Beware of various types of fake news outlets.
        * Imposter sites
            ~ Mimic valid sties to spread fake news 
        * Manipulated content
            ~ Original content has been manipulated to fit the dialog of the postig site.
        * Fabricated Content 
            ~ All of it is untrue
    - "Pizzagate"
        * Fake news during the 2016 Election:
            ~ Comet Ping Pong Pizza was said to be involved in a child pornography ring with presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and Multiple members of congress.
            ~ An Individual with an AK-47 showed up threating to shoot anybody involved in child pornography in 2016.
            ~ Determined to be fabricated in order to hurt the clinton campaign.
    _ Verify sources when reading a story of interest online:
        * Check the author 
        * Check The supporting links
        * WHo else is reporting it 
        * Consider the intent of the story.
