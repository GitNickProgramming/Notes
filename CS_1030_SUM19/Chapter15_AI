II. Introductions
    - Artificial Intelligence (AI):
        * Creating computer systems that exhibit aspects of intelligence
        * What is intelligence? 
    - The Turing test:
        * Human Judge questions two hidden entities
        * One entity is a computer
        * If judge cannot distinguish computer from person, then computer is intelligent!
III. A Division of Labor
    - Computational tasks:
        * Example:
            ~ Recognizing an individual's face
        * Typically have algorithmic solutions.
        * Computers perform faster than humans.
        * Computers Perform more accurately than humans.
    - Recognition Tasks:
        * Example:
            ~ Recognizing an individual's face
        * Process massive amounts of sensory information
        * Access massive amounts of past experience
        * Require approximation
        * Huamns perform much better than computers
    - Reasoning task:
        * Example:
            ~ Planning you major in college
        * Formal reasoning can be autmated to some extent.
            ~ Problems become intractable quickly.
        * Common-sense reasoing:
            ~ Requires great experience and knowledge.
IV. Knowledge Representation
    - How can we represent knowledge for the computer?
        * Natural Language:
            ~ Use requires understanding of meanings of words and combinations of words.
            ~ "Spot is a brown dog"
            ~ "Every dog has four legs"
        * Formal language:
            ~ Language is a formal logic.
            ~ "Sport is a bown dog" becomes, dog(Spot) and Brown(Spot)
        * Pictorial Representation:
            ~ Knowledge as a digital picture
            ~ Cannot represent categorical information 
            ~ Example:
                + every dog has four legs
        * Graphical Representation:
            ~ Knowledge as nodes connected by edges.
        * Semantic net:
            ~ Nodes for objects or categories of objects.
            ~ Edges for relationships
            ~ Nodes inherit features through "isa" relationships
    - Reqirments of a representation:
        * Adequacy:
            ~ Must capture all relevant information.
        * Efficiency:
            ~ Avoid redundant information 
        * Extendibility:
            ~ Easy to add new knowledge
        * Appropriate:
            ~ Easy to use for particular purpose.
V. Recoginition tasks:
    - Some AI work attempts to mimic the brain.
    - Humans have 86 billion (10^12) neurons.
    - A neuron receives electrical stimuli from other neurons through dendrites.
    - A neuron sends electrical stimuli through its axon.
    - Signals pass through gaps, synapses.
    - Some synapses cause increased activations; others inhibit activation.
    - Neurons are like very simple computational devices.
    - The nervous system is like a connectionist architecture:
        * Processing aries from many simple processors with rich and complex conections.
    - Procesing in the brain occurs in a masively parallel way.
        * Individual neurons are slow compared to computer computational speeds.
        * Allows for redundancy and neuron failure (fault tolerant)
    - Artificial neural networks mimic the connectionist approach.
    - Individual artificial "neurons" have:
        * A Threshold for generatings output.
        * An activation level.
        * Incoming weighted edges.
        * Outgoing weighted edges.
    - Neural networks are often organized into input and output layers.
    - To provide an input to the network, fix the values of the input layer to 0 to 1.
    - Output nodes compute weighted sum of all inputs.
        * Activation from node I to node j is Wij * xi
    - Networks with only input and output layers:
        * Can solve many problems, but
        * Cannot solve XOR (or many others)
    - Add an intermediate layer between input and output
        * Hidden layer
    - Can solve most problems given the right weights
    - How can we determine the correct weights?
        * Neural Networks are "trained" on sample data.
        * Machine Learning:
            ~ The network "learns" correct responses to inputs.
    - Training neural networks:
        * Training data:
            ~ Input/output pairs where output is known to be correct for input.
            ~ Output nodes that are incorrect have quantifiable error.
            ~ Use error to update weights to generate less error.
            ~ Backpropagation:
                > algorithm that propagates errors back through hidden layer(s) to input.
VI. Reasoning Tasks Intelligent Searching:
    - Decision tree represents possible next items for which to search.
    - Linear search and binary search assume:
        * Data is organized linearly
        * Exact match is required 
    - What if we relax the requirements?
        * What if data is not linear?
        * What if an approximate match is okay?
    - State-space graph:
        * Each node is a state of aour problem.
        * A node connects to another if that state can be directly generated by the node.
        * Examples:
            ~ Tic-tac-toe
            ~ Eight-puzzle
            ~ Maze-solving
        * State-space search:
            ~ Seeks a path from start state to goal state.
    - Searching for a path to a goal:
        * Brute Force:
            ~ Trace all branches of decision tree.
                + Too slow
        * Heuristics:
            ~ Use educated guess to guide which branches to search.
        * Examples:
            ~ Chess:
                + Brute force is impossible.
                + Good heuristics enable computers to play at grand master level.
                + Chess is the last "easy" hard problem.
VII. Reasoning Tasks Swarm Intelligence
    - Swarm Intelligence Model:
        * Model communities of simple agents
            ~ Ants 
            ~ Termites
        * Ant Colonies:

                + Arranges Meetings
IX. Reasoning Tasks Expert Systems
    - Expert System:
        * Mimics reasoning in some specific domain.
        * Forward Chaining:
            ~ Start with assertions >> look for rules to ducuce new assertions.
            ~ Given assertion A and rule "if A then B" >> deduce B.
        * Backward chaining:
            ~ Start with a Query >> look for rules that could deduce query.
            ~ Given questions "Is B true?" and rule "if A then B" >> Try to determine "is A true?"
    - Knwoeldge base:

        * Many programs use forms of state-space search:
        * Tic-tac-toe:
            ~ Small state space
            ~ Brute force works to play perfectly
        * Checkers
            ~ Chainook project built and searched the complete state space.
            ~ results can be embedded in a computer player.
            ~ Chinook can never be beaten
        * Chess:
            ~ State space is too large to solve.
            ~ Computer Players depend on heuristics

        * Go:
            ~ Huge search space.
            ~ Difficult for a computer to play well

                + Update: Deep Mind defeated the Go world champion 4-1 (2018)
    - Quiz Games:
        * Jeopardy!
            ~ Watson defeated Jeopardy! Champions (2011)
