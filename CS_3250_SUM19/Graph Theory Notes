1. Graph Theory
    a) The study of graphs, which are mathematical structures used to model pairwise relations between objects.
        - A graph in this context is made up of vertices (also called nodes or points) which are connected by edges (also called links or lines).
    b) Undirected graphs
        - A set of objects (called vertices or nodes) that are connected together, where all the edges are bidirectional.
        - Edges link two vertices symmetrically
    c) Directed graphs
        - A set of objects (called vertices or nodes) that are connected together, where all the edges are directed from one vertex to another.
        - Where edges link two vertices asymmetrically

1. Abstract
    - This paper gives an overview of the applications that uses graph theoretical concepts.
    - Various papers based on graph theory have been studied related to scheduling concepts, computer science applications and an overview has been presented here.
    - Keywords:
        * Bipartite Graph
        * Ad-hoc networks
        * Geometric Spanner
        * Median Graph
        * Voronoi Graph
2. Applications of Graph Theory
    - Widely used to study and model various applications, in different areas:
    a) Study of Molecules
        - Construction of bonds in chemistry and the study of atoms
    b) Sociology
        - Measure an Actors prestige or to explore diffusion mechanisms
    c) Biology
        - conservation efforts where a vertex represents regions where certain specis exist and the edges represent migration path or movement between the regions
        - Information can be used to look at breeding patterns or tracking the spread of a disease, parasites and to study the impact of migrations that affect other species.
    d) Operations Research (OR)
        - The Traveling salesman problem
            + the shortest spanning tree in a weighted graph
            + optimal match of jobs and men and locating the shortest path between two vertices in a graph
3. Algorithms and Graph Theory
    - These aglorithms are used to solve the graph theoretical concepts which intern used to solve the corresponding computer science application problems.
    a) Some Algorithms are:
        * Shortest path algorithm in a networks
        * Finding a minimum spanning tree
        * Finding graph planarity
        * Algorithms to find adjacency matrices
        * Algorithms to find the connectedness
        * Algorithms to find the cycles in a graph
        * Algorithms for searching an element in a data structure (Depth First Search - DFS, Breadth First Search - BFS) and so on.
    b) Graph Theory in OR
        - Graph theory is a very natural and powerful tool in combinatorial operations research. 
        - A network called transport network where a graph is used to model the transportation of commodity from one place to another. 
        - The objective is to maximize the flow or minimize the cost within the prescribed flow.
        - The graph theoretic approach is found more efficient for these types of problems though they have more constraints
4. Bipartite Graph
    - A graph whose vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets U and V such that every edge connects a vertex in U to one in V
    - That is, U and V are independent sets
